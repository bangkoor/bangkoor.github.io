## Overview

Friendly, organized, modern landing page with pastel geometry. Ideal for apps de produtividade, educational platforms, saas friendly, health apps. AI-ready template. Pastel geometry didn't emerge from nowhere — it's the logical endpoint of two parallel movements colliding. On one side, you had the flat design revolution of 2012-2014 stripping interfaces down to pure color and shape. On the other, the wellness industry was quietly rejecting the clinical whites and sterile blues of healthcare UI, reaching instead for warmth. The merger happened around 2018 when apps like Calm and Headspace proved that soft color palettes could carry serious product experiences without feeling childish.

What makes this system interesting is its deliberate rejection of edge. Where material design gave us shadows and depth, pastel geometry insists on flatness as a philosophical stance — nothing here demands attention aggressively. The rounded pills and blob shapes aren't decorative; they're functional signals that say 'this space is safe, slow down.' It borrows from Scandinavian product design's obsession with approachable form, translated into pixels.

The geometry part matters more than people think. Without structural rigor — consistent radii, mathematical spacing, repeating shape languages — pastels collapse into nursery aesthetics. The geometry is what gives it adult credibility.
